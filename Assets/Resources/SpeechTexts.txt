Starts give off magical power, I have to search for light and recharge my crystals.
There are enemies ahead I can feel it.
Maybe I can bypass the door through the sewers.
It seems like ordinary lifeforms mutated since our journey, I need to find out what happened.
There is a strong presence in this room.
Seems like humans are still around, language didn't change much. What were they searching for?
Seems like a lot of time passed by, this was a city once.Now it's just dunes and forgotten ruins.
Can't believe this place has been left to rot, such a waste.
There might be clues around what happend to this place since I was gone.
So they never learned what happend to us? The mighty Golden Rouges become nothin more than folktale.
At such hight I can't fall otherwise I will probably die.
Our resolve is a must ... I'm disgusted by my ability of tought.
