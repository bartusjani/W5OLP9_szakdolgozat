What happened to this place?
1
It seems Magic must work the same, yet it feels so unfamiliar.
This place has been abandoned fully, what happened since our journey?
Maybe I can bypass the door through the sewers.
2
It seems like ordinary lifeforms mutated since our journey, I need to find out what happened.

Such a strong lifeform with the presence of magic shouldn't exist, it seems like humans have lost the favor of the Gods.
The Golden Age of Humanity? We had so much more potential.
Imbicels, they know half the truth and even that is twisted.
So they never learned what happend to us? The mighty Golden Rouges become nothin more than folktale.
There is even a way to go higher?
Such a tireing task. WHat a dishonor to the Golden Rouges their journey point has been left in this state!
It's good that we came back for our new cause, we shall get rid of this dsigrace of humanity.
