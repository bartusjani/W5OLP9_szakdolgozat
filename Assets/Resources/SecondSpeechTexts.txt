What happened to this place?
Starts give off magical power, I have to search for light and recharge my crystals.
It seems Magic must work the same, yet it feels so unfamiliar.
There are enemies ahead I can feel it.
This place has been abandoned fully, what happened since our journey?
Maybe I can bypass the door through the sewers.
It seems like ordinary lifeforms mutated since our journey, I need to find out what happened.
There is a strong presence in this room.
Such a strong lifeform with the presence of magic shouldn't exist, it seems like humans have lost the favor of the Gods.
Seems like humans are still around, language didn't change much.
What were they searching for?
The Golden Age of Humanity?
We had so much more potential.
Seems like a lot of time passed by, this was a city once.Now it's just dunes and forgotten ruins.
Imbicels, they know half the truth and even that is twisted.
Can't believe this place has been left to rot, such a waste.
There might be clues around what happend to this place since I was gone.
So they never learned what happend to us? The mighty Golden Rouges become nothin more than folktale.

There is even a way to go higher?
At suck hight I can't fall otherwise I will probably die.
Suck a tireing task. WHat a dishonor to the Golden Rouges their journey point has been left in this state!.
It's good that we came back for our new cause, we shall get rid of this dsigrace of humanity.
Our resolve is a must ... I'm disgusted by my ability of tought.
